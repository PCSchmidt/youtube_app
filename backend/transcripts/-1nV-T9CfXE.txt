what's going on everybody hope your day is going well Liam here from the teal content team and in this video I want to go over four ways you can use Chad GPT to optimize your LinkedIn profile now optimize your LinkedIn profile what does that even mean well it basically means nailing down the areas of your LinkedIn profile that are one important for a complete profile two the areas that will help your profile show up in search results and three getting in good information that a hiring manager who visits your profile will be looking for if you want to see more about that optimization process we have a whole LinkedIn tips playlist on our YouTube channel check it out or you can hit the card at the top right of the screen but for this video we're talking about chat GPT so let's do it the first area of our LinkedIn profile we want to work on is right here our about section you can think of this as kind of a professional intro a bit of a career summary just a nice paragraph that somebody can read really quick and get an idea of your career who you are as a professional and read some of your top achievements our about section right now isn't half bad we've got some metrics in there and we have some achievements but it's on the short side and I think we can definitely do better so let's hop over to chatgpt our prompt in chat GPT is going to be write a professional summary using my resume for reference include keywords and metrics and keep it less than 100 words then of course because we're using our resume for reference you want to go grab your resume highlight the whole thing here right click copy back in chat GPT shift enter twice to drop down a couple lines right click paste quick note here on the prompt we obviously said professional summary this is going to give us great results for our LinkedIn about section but if you need a professional summary for your resume you can drop the exact same thing in here but back in chat gbt let's hit go the results are going to write out it's always fun to kind of watch it think for a bit and now looking at the results let's make sure we have all the right information we have our Target title we have years of experience we also have achievements here with metrics and we also have our education here which we didn't even specify so thank you Chad GPT these results look good so let's go and highlight the whole thing right click copy over in LinkedIn we're going to edit our LinkedIn about section we're going to highlight the whole thing hit backspace to delete it paste in our new results and hit save our LinkedIn about section is looking stronger let's also go in our resume we're here in our teal resume Builder we're going to go to professional summary we're going to edit professional summary same thing here highlight paste in our new results from chatgpt hit save and now our professional summary is also updated now moving on to item number two the next place of our LinkedIn profile we're going to work on is right here in our LinkedIn headline if we take a look at what we have right now senior marketing manager social media marketing we're going to fly out the teal Chrome extension click on Headline to see what we can work on recommendations show add more keywords to your headline and use at least 100 characters so now over in chatbt let's give it a prompt to generate a new LinkedIn headline we want to say write a LinkedIn headline using my resume for reference include keywords from my resume and keep it shorter than 220 characters 220 characters is the max limit for your LinkedIn headline so you want to use as much as possible let's go back to our teal resume Builder let's highlight our whole resume again right click copy back to chat GPT right click paste hit enter and wait for our results looking at the results brand marketing Pro 13 years experience SEO content and growth marketing and now we're on to achievements 25 plus brand awareness 20 conversion boost and now we have some certification in education SQL a masters in marketing management and a BS in Communications this looks really good so let's copy everything in our LinkedIn profile we're going to click the pencil right here look at our headline we're going to copy everything paste in our new results from Chachi PT hit save and just to verify we're going to fly out the Chrome extension again we have a green check next to headline so we are good to move on the next place of our LinkedIn profile that we want to work on is down here in experience you can think of this pretty much one to one with the work experience section of your resume so let's use Chad gbt to write some new work achievements so over here in chatgpt our prompt is going to be right three resume achievements for a marketing coordinator include metrics and keywords now this is where things get kind of tricky after our prompt you want to go and grab the job description of the job that you were hired for or find a job posting that is live in a very similar position and what you're going to do is you're going to copy the whole thing here right click copy back to chat gbt right click pay hit enter let the results think for a bit and now we have our achievements the thing here is it's very unlikely that the success metrics the exact number is going to be accurate to your specific instance what you want to do here is look at these as almost a framework our achievement one here says increased lead generation by 35 lead generation is a keyword for our job if we did increase it maybe we just need to change this 35 percent to what it actually is or maybe we increased something else so we just need to change lead generation so use these results as a framework go through make the edits and the customizations that you need then once everything's done back here on our LinkedIn profile we're going to go up to experience we're going to hit the pencil to edit we're going to go down to marketing coordinator hit edit again in chatgpt we're going to copy our achievement we're going to clear our old achievements right click paste drop down a couple lines copy the next achievement from chat should be T paste copy the third achievement from chat gbt back in LinkedIn paste hit save our achievements here are looking really nice so let's move on the last way we're going to use chatbt to help with our LinkedIn is by generating LinkedIn messages in chatgpt our prompt here is going to be write a LinkedIn message to thank the hiring manager for their time for the interview for the title at company that's my placeholder here obviously you would want to fill in the exact title and the exact company and if you have the name of the hiring manager that's even better and now let's check out the results we've got our subject line we've got deer hiring manager's name in chatgpt results you get brackets around the placeholder details that you should go in and fill in later we're thanking the hiring manager for the opportunity again you want to fill in the title of the position and the company we're touching on what we liked about the company and what we liked about our time interviewing we always want to thank them for their time and consideration and the opportunity and we have a great sign off here offering additional availability for follow-up information or next steps once again any place where placeholder details are to be expected you want to fill in those for sure before sending this off but these results look really good so you want to copy them somewhere safe we're here on our LinkedIn job tracker we're going to fly out the notes area yeah we're going to paste them in and now they're kept safe for the next time we have an interview and we want to follow up with the hiring manager we know where to look well thank you so much for your time today we hope you enjoyed yourself drop a like on the video and subscribe to the channel for more content
